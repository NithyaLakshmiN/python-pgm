#Method overriding is an ability of any object-oriented programming language that allows a subclass or child class
# to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes.
# When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature and same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class.
